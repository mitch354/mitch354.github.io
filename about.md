My name is Mitchell Hole and I just recently graduated from Simon Fraser University
with a BASC in Computer Science. I transferred into CS in my second year after taking an intro programming course as an elective and have been hooked ever since. As an avid Mixed Martial Arts fan and particularly enjoy applying the programming and data science skills I have acquired to providing novel
 insights into it.
